Drawabox Cube Practice Tool
About This Tool
This interactive web application is designed to enhance your cube drawing and perspective skills, aligning with the principles taught in the Drawabox curriculum. It provides a dynamic 3D environment where you can generate and manipulate cubes, offering visual aids like adjustable vanishing points and orthogonal lines to deepen your understanding of spatial relationships.

Key Features
Flexible 3D Cube Customization: Easily modify cube dimensions (width, height, depth) to create diverse forms.

Visual Modes: Toggle between solid, wireframe, and translucent rendering for varied visual feedback.

Controllable Lighting: Adjust light source type, intensity, color, and position to observe shading effects.

Dynamic Perspective Guides: Overlay a 3D grid, activate vanishing lines, and choose between 1-point, 2-point, or 3-point perspective. Includes interactive, draggable vanishing points.

Geometric Distortions: Apply skew transformations on X, Y, and Z axes to practice drawing objects under various distortions.

Camera Control: Utilize orbit, zoom, and pan functionalities, or input precise numerical values for camera position and target.

Practice Tracking: Set and monitor daily cube drawing goals, with a built-in timer and cube counter. Quickly generate new random cubes or camera views.

Session Management: Undo and redo changes, and save/load your preferred cube configurations and camera views as custom presets.

Export Options: Capture and save screenshots of your practice scenes.

Adaptive Interface: Fully responsive design for consistent experience across devices.

Tips for Drawabox Practice
This tool serves as an excellent companion to your Drawabox studies. Keep these fundamental principles in mind:

Ghosting: Practice smooth, confident strokes.

Perspective: Develop a strong understanding of how lines converge towards vanishing points.

Rotation: Challenge yourself by drawing objects from diverse angles.

Shading: Learn to effectively render form using light and shadow.

Reference: Leverage the dynamic 3D cube as a versatile visual reference.

Consistency: Regular practice is the most important factor for improvement!
